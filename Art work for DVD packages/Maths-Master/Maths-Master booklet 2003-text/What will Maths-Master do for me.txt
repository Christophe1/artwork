What will Maths-Master do for me? 

Maths-Master will : 

 enable you to learn at your own pace, and in your own time. 

 enable you to study material as often as you wish, without the need for a supervisor or teacher. 

 Improve your study techniques. By working with pen and paper and using the 'Hint' button to guide you step by step, you will become familiar with the methods used to solve Junior or Leaving Cert. standard problems. 


 Focus you on what you really need to know. Maths-Master is made by an Irish company and Irish educators. All the content is 100% related to the Junior and Leaving Cert. syllabi.  

 Provide a new and interesting way to learn. More than the traditional textbook Maths-Master prompts you through a problem, providing guidance with reminders, pictures, interactive diagrams and suggestions.

 serve as an excellent revision tool for the Junior Cert. or Leaving Cert. exams. 

 save the teachers time, as they won't have to be constantly by the side of the student.
