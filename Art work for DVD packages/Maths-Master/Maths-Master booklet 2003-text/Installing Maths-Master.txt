Installing Maths-Master 


Maths-Master has to be installed onto your computer before you can use it. 


To install Maths-Master :


1. Insert the Maths-Master CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive. The installer should start by itself in a few moments. 

If the installer doesn't start automatically, from the Windows Start menu select Run. Enter the drive letter associated with your CD-ROM drive, then

    :\autorun.exe

    and click OK. 



2. When the Installer appears, choose the Maths-Master product of your choice. You can always choose more products later by contacting us for an Unlock Code.



3. In the Choose Destination Location, the default location is in your computer's Program Files folder. Click the Browse button, located beside the white text box, to install Maths-Master into a different folder.

Once your Maths-Master product has been installed all you need to do in future is to click the Maths-Master icon which appears on your desktop, and this will run the program.

 

Note: On most newer operating systems, Macromedia Shockwave Flash technology is included with Windows. Shockwave Flash is required for Maths-Master to work correctly. 

Shockwave Flash is included on the Maths-Master CD-ROM, in the Shockwave folder. 

You will need to install Shockwave Flash if:

1. You receive an error message in relation to a file called 'SWFLASH.OCX' when you are using Maths-Master.

2. The buttons in Maths-Master are not visible, or are not functioning correctly.

If either of the above problems occur, or you are in doubt as to whether or not Shockwave Flash is on your computer, install it from the Maths-Master CD-ROM, in the Shockwave folder.
